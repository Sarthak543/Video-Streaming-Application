This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Video-Streaming-Application
A platform with a single page interface where user can upload and stream video. The  primary focus of this project is to implement chunked video streaming, sending video files to the client in  segments rather than all at once, ensuring efficient and seamless playback across devices.
